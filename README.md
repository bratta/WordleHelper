# WordleHelper

If you are playing [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), this application is a helper for keeping track of letters and word choices. It's kind of cheaty, but whatever.

This is quick and dirty and not to be taken serious. It's a fun bit of code and works for me, but it is by FAR from being complete or efficient. YMMV

## Installation

* You need a reasonably new version of Ruby. I used 3.0 for this. You also need the bundler gem.
* Check out the code
* Run `bundle install`

That should be it!

## Usage

Run the following script on OS X or Linux:

`exe/wordle-helper`
